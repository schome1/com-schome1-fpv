# RaceCommander Startup

The first screen you will see when you launch RaceCommander is the startup (splash) screen.  
This screen will show you the version of RaceCommander that you are currently using.

## Courses

The Courses screen allows you to enter a course, which identifies a specific course layout.  The course will store all race results for each pilot who races on the course.
To add a course, touch the **circled + button** at the top right of the screen. You must add at least one course.

It is best to name your courses to indicate the location, layout identifier, and perhaps a time frame that the course will be in use.  Example course names could be:

- Garage (2025)
- My Garage (2025)
- My Yard (June-October, 2025)

To edit the name of a league, touch the league to get to the course details screen and touch the **circled pencil button** at the top right of the screen.

To delete a course, swipe from right to left over the course and touch the **Delete** button.  ⚠️ This will delete all of the data for this league.

To continue to the course screen, touch the course in the list that you want to view.

## Course Races

In the **Course** screen, you will see three tabs:  

- **Pilots** tab – view/add pilots to the course
- **Races** tab – view/add races to the course
- **Stats** tab – view course statistics

When you view the course for the first time, you will see a message indicating that you need to add at least one pilot.  See the **Pilots** section below to learn how to view/add pilots to the course.

After adding pilots, you will be able to add races to the course. Go to the **Races** tab to learn how to view/add races to the course.

## Course Pilots

Touch the **circled + button** at the top right of the screen to add pilots.

To edit a pilot’s name/call sign, long touch the pilot’s name and select **"Edit Pilot"** from the context menu.

## Course Races

Races are groupings of **race heats**.  
A heat allows pilots to race multiple times during a race event, generating results based on the **average performance** of all their heats.

To add a race, touch the **circled + button** at the top right of the screen.

While adding a race, you can change the **date** and **time** of the race.

Each race will have a **numbered icon** to the left of it, indicating how many races the league contains.  
This also allows you to refer to the race by number.

A **race event** contains one or more heats.  
You do **not** need to create a separate race event for each pilot—**race heats** are used for that.

To add **race heats** to a race event, touch the race event you just created.  
This will take you to the **Race Heats** screen, where you will see three tabs at the bottom of the screen:

## Course Race

## Race Heats

## Race Heat

## Race Stats

## Course Stats


## Race Heats

Each time there is a race within a race event, a **heat** should be used to capture the results.  
If you are splitting heats to avoid video interference, only one heat is required,  
and the pilot results can be entered in the same heat.

To add a heat, go to the **Heats** tab and touch the **circled + button** at the top right of the screen.

The heats are **named and numbered** for easy reference.

To enter the **pilot lap count** for a heat, touch the heat name/number and enter the lap count for each pilot.

After saving each pilot’s lap count, you will return to the **Race Heats** screen.  
Touching a heat will allow you to further edit lap counts.

To view the **race event stats**, touch the **Stats** tab at the bottom of the screen.  
Stats will update dynamically throughout the course of each heat and each race event in a league.

The **first race event** will always result in a **zero handicap** for all pilots.  
A pilot’s handicap is calculated only after the **second race event** has started.  
Each pilot must participate in **one race event** to have a handicap.
