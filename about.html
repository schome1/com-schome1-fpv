    <h2>About Schome1</h2>
    <p>
      I've always had a passion for flying. When I was young, I'd build airplanes, jets, and spacecraft out of Legos, and every time a plane flew overhead, 
      I'd look up and stare at it, thinking how cool it would be to be in control of an airplane.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fast forward to 2011, when I bought my first RC airplane.  I flew it until it broke.  Then I found a way to fix it, and I flew it until it broke again. 
      This cycle repeated for a while, but in the process, I learned how to repair the plane and I started learning about the electronics that
      are required to keep things working.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2013, a friend of mine was having trouble with his LOS multirotor and he was going to throw it away. When I told him I'd take a look 
      at it, he said that if I could fix it, I could keep it.  I fixed it, and this is what propelled me even deeper into this hobby.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2014, I built my first FPV drone and used a 20" HDTV as the monitor.  It was amazing!
    </p>

    <p>
      By 2017, I had my first set of goggles and racing drones was a real thing.  We had a small group of pilots who would get together whenever we 
      could to setup a small course and race.  Our drones of choice were 3-4S with 5" props.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2021, I experimented with 1S and 2S drones for outdoor use.  The 2S drones proved to have enough power for a race and the benefit of them over 
      4S and 6S drones was that the 2S, 2-3" drones could be flown in my back yard with very little concern of damaging property or people due to their 
      small size and weight.  This was very appealing to me, so I eventually sold all of my 5" 4S - 6S drones and equipment so I could focus on 2-3" 2S 
      drones. I have not looked back.  2S drones are a lot of fun to fly, for racing or freestyle. I have not been disappointed since moving away from 5", 
      4S/6S drones to 2-3", 2S drones.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was in 2022 when HDZero was introduced to the public.  This is when I realized what was always missing in my analog FPV view.  It was also the year 
      when we perfected the 75mm 2S drone frame and started flying more indoors in the winter, with our 75mm 2S builds that had HDZero on board.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since starting to fly FPV, I have built so many drones that I made a rule for what I consider a new build.  My rule is this:  if I reuse a flight 
      controller, then I do not consider the build new, it's a repair or an upgrade.  However, if I build with a brand new flight controller, it's a new build. 
      Given this rule, I have built a total of 89 drones as of 12/31/2023.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2017, I started logging all of my flights.  I have used various means of keeping track of all of the data, but I finally wrote an iOS app 
      that I've been using for a few years now.  As of 1/1/2024, I've logged 12,557 flights, with 2023 being the year in which I flew the most flights 
      in a single year (3001 flights)!  If I'm not flying to test drone equipment or settings, I'll fly to perfect my drone racing skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      In January of 2024, I decided that I should create a website that highlights the things I've been working on in regards to my own wants and needs 
      in the hobby.  The short list of highlights include designing drone parts that can be 3D printed, designing drone frames, using various equipment 
      to form an opinion of what I like to use and what fits my style of flying the best, and creating printed circuit boards (PCBs) that assist with certain 
      things that I found to be tedious without the PCBs.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal for this website is that it can be used as a resource for fellow drone enthusiasts, especially those who enjoy flying the 2-3" 2S drones.
    </p>

    <h2>Flying Style</h2>
    <p>
      My flying style is about 70% racing and 30% freestyle. I like racing because there is a lot of skill involved, a lot of strategy, and sometimes, 
      you just need to forget about the fear of crasshing so you can push forward to attain a better race time. Racing is exilerating. I also like flying 
      through the trees in my back yard, cruising around my yard, and getting a birds-eye view of things.
